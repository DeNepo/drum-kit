# Drum Kit: Development Strategy

Building this site one step at a time

---

## 0. README

* Write the `README.md`, including the final screen shot
* Include a License
* Include this `development.md` file

---

## 1. Setup

* Create boilerplate index.html

---

## 2. User Story: Display Keyboard

__A user can see which sound each key will make__

### DOM:

* Create one element per key in the drumset, with child elements to display the key name and sound it will make
* Create a container for all of the key elements

---

## 3. User Story: Play Sounds

__A user can press the displayed keys and hear the sound__

### Assets:

* Create a `/sounds` folder containing all of the .wav files

### DOM:

* Create audio tags with paths to the sound assets
* Create script tags for the Handler & Listener
* Create `data-key` attributes to link the key elements with the audio elements

### Listeners:

* Attach a `keyup` event to the window object.

### Handlers:

* Create a `playSound` event handler that checks to see if the pressed key has a linked audio sound. If it does, play the sound!

---

## 4. User Story: See Beauty

__A user can use a well-styled page__

### Assets:

* Add the background image to  `/images`

### Styles:

* Require and apply the background image
* Create styles for the keys

### DOM:

* Create a link tag to require the styles
* Add classes to styled elements

---

## 5. User Story: Animate Keys

__A user can know which keys are currently pressed__

### Styles:

* Create a class for keys that are currently pressed

### Handlers:

* Create a `removeTransition` handler to remove the `.playing` class when a key is released
* Update the `playHandler` to add the `.playing` class when a key is pressed

### Listeners:

* Add a `transitionend` listener to each element with the `.key` class, with the `removeTransition` handler.
